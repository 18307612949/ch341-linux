notes on adding parity control support to ch341.c, the linux driver for, 
as BSD calls it, "the worst usb serial chip in the world"

it actually works just fine in windows, and in linux with no-parity, at least
for the basic usages I have for it, but yeah, it's ugly datasheet world :)

Now to just actually edit the kernel module...

Enabling debug from the kernel module:
sudo su -c 'echo "file ch341.c +p" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control'
or
sudo su -c 'echo "module ch341 +p" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control'

Building it (from a linux tree checkout matching your running kernel on
fedora...)
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`/drivers/usb/serial modules
